Using supervisor
================

Supervisor is a very nice way to manage you Python processes. We won't cover the setup (which is just apt-get install supervisor or pip install supervisor most of the time), but here is a quick overview on how to use it.

Create a configuration file named security\_monkey.conf under /etc/supervisor/conf.d/:

    # Control Startup/Shutdown:
    # sudo supervisorctl

    [program:securitymonkey]
    user=www-data
    environment=PYTHONPATH='/usr/local/src/security_monkey/',SECURITY_MONKEY_SETTINGS="/usr/local/src/secmonkey-config/env-config/config-local.py"
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    command=python /usr/local/src/security_monkey/manage.py run_api_server

    [program:securitymonkeyscheduler]
    user=www-data
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    directory=/usr/local/src/security_monkey/
    environment=PYTHONPATH='/usr/local/src/security_monkey/',SECURITY_MONKEY_SETTINGS="/usr/local/src/secmonkey-config/env-config/config-local.py"
    command=python /usr/local/src/security_monkey/manage.py start_scheduler

The 4 first entries are just boiler plate to get you started, you can copy them verbatim.

The last one define one (you can have many) process supervisor should manage.

It means it will run the command:

    python manage.py run_api_server

In the directory, with the environment and the user you defined.

This command will be ran as a daemon, in the background.

autostart and autorestart just make it fire and forget: the site will always be running, even it crashes temporarily or if you restart the machine.

Normally run supervisor:

    sudo service supervisor restart

Then you can manage the process by running:

    sudo supervisorctl

It will start a shell from were you can start/stop/restart the service

You can read all errors that might occurs from /tmp/securitymonkey.log.
